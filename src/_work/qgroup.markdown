  Qgroup is a global technology company that offers pretty much everything in the digital realm. They have offices all around the world, but their heart and head(quarters) remain in their beloved Malmö.

  Every single person that signs that prized employment contract walks the walk of pride, through an ACTUAL tunnel, into Qgroup's inner sanctum – their super hip and swanky Malmö office.

  When we were commissioned to update Qgroup's website, we came to the conclusion pretty quickly that the tunnel experience needed to be emphasized. It’s a defining experience that every employee, new and experienced, shares.

section3: |
  One slight problem, though. The real tunnel isn't exactly finished. They are renovating as we speak. Nevertheless, we heard their vision and were handed the blueprints, CAD models and everything else we needed to get to work. Which led us to the deep and ancient question:
  Who is quicker? Fully, or a construction crew?

  The verdict is in. We are.


section4: |
  We used WebGL to make the tunnel an immersive web experience, letting the mouse or mobile gyro guide the exploring. And if you get tired of looking around you could just use the secret key (it's the Q tangent on your keyboard — we’re not so good with secrets). This ushers you to the elusive light at the end of the tunnel: the coveted employee zone.

  #### The rest of the site is quite spectacularly dynamic too, but you should [go traverse it](https://q.group) on your own. Because, to paraphrase Qgroup – everything begins with the tunnel.
