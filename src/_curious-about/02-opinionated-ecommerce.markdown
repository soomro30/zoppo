  In the past few years, Fully has been tinkering with norms of e-commerce. You might even say pursuing the holy grail of a perfect webstore. And if not “perfect,” then at least way more interesting and engaging than they currently are.

  Much of what is charming about visiting a brick-and-mortar store has been lost in the translation to the web. When we started looking at it with design eyes, we found online shopping was unsatisfying for a host of reasons. 

section2: |
  We were curious about what would happen if we tried applying the principles of an in-real-life store to one on the web. With our two webstore experiments, Owd Bob and Atioki, we tested a few of these principles.

  ## Tested

  ### Presence
  In a floor store, when you go through looking for your sizes, you mess things up a bit. Your presence creates a change in the environment. 

  We like experimenting with creating presence on the web. For Atioki we sought to digitally mimic this “mess,” but in a way that was integrated with the function and purpose of the shopping experience. 

  So we developed a method of looking at the product from different angles with a kind of hover-triggered slide effect: 

  [example] 

  The images don’t return to their initial state, but rather stay as you left them. This provides the feeling and visual effect of ruffling the products and creating a ripple in the webstore.

  ## Secret clubhouse
  When it came to marketing, we didn’t go for range – we aimed at exclusivity. We started off, only using Instagram. And mainly promote the artist in our posts. This way we could focus on varied, quality content. We also only wanted to follow interesting artists, not people likely to follow us back, figuring that more followers could lower the sense of exclusivity. Every follower should be someone interested in art, not interested in getting followers of their own. 

  The opening hours was also revealed on Instagram only. If you missed it, you needed to go back and check. Otherwise the opportunity is gone. And the store is closed again. We hope this would get people to actively visit our profile. And hopefully see the opening as an event.

  Our plan worked. We gained a lot of interest and got contacted by several journalists who wanted to write about the project. For instance, My clever Lab named us Startup of the week. And the artists told us that they have sold more prints during the 48 hours than they had in a year when featured on some of the print on demand alternatives out there.

section5: |
  ## Alive and growing
  The Owd Bob store is constantly evolving. We always look at new possibilities to present and sell the prints. And new ways to market the site. At the same time. Fully is steadily improving and finding new tools in how to market on the web, with an extremely low budget.
